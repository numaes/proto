Target Applications
===================

Proto is ideally suited for a wide range of applications where custom language design and efficient execution are paramount. Its flexibility makes it a powerful tool for:

*   **Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)**: Create highly specialized languages for specific industries or problem domains, improving productivity and reducing errors.
*   **Scripting Languages**: Develop lightweight, embeddable scripting languages for applications, games, or automation.
*   **Experimental Languages**: Rapidly prototype and test new language concepts and paradigms without the overhead of building a full-fledged runtime from scratch.
*   **Educational Tools**: Provide a simplified environment for teaching programming language theory and compiler design.
*   **High-Performance Computing**: Design languages optimized for parallel processing or specific hardware architectures.
