Project Overview
================

Proto is a cutting-edge runtime environment designed for the rapid development and execution of new programming languages. It provides a robust, high-performance foundation, abstracting away the complexities of low-level system interactions and memory management. This allows language designers and developers to focus on the unique features and semantics of their languages, accelerating innovation and reducing time-to-market.

Key Features:

*   **High Performance**: Optimized for speed and efficiency, ensuring your languages run smoothly.
*   **Memory Management**: Handles memory allocation and deallocation automatically, preventing common errors.
*   **Extensibility**: Designed to be easily extended and adapted to various language paradigms.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Built with portability in mind, enabling your languages to run on diverse operating systems.
*   **Simplified Development**: Reduces the boilerplate code typically required for runtime creation.
